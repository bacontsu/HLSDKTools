REM This is an example batch file that uses WadMaker to convert all images in 'C:\HL\mymod\textures\chapter1' and its sub-directories
REM to textures, which are then saved in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\mymod\chapter1.wad'.
REM The -subdirs option causes WadMaker to also look for images in sub-directories.

REM To use this batch file, replace the directory paths below with the right paths for your system, and then remove the 'REM ' from the line below:
REM "C:\HL\tools\WadMaker.exe" -subdirs "C:\HL\mymod\textures\chapter1" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life\mymod\chapter1.wad"
